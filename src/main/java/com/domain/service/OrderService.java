// SCATTERED LOGIC FOR ADDING, UPDATING, OR RETRIEVING ORDERS IN CONTROLLERS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED IN TO THIS SERVICE.


/**
 * Service class for managing order-related business logic.
 *
 * The OrderService class acts as an intermediary between the controllers
 * and the OrderManager model. It provides methods to handle orders, such as
 * creating, updating, retrieving, and managing their lifecycle.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - To encapsulate order-related operations and logic.
 * - To ensure the separation of concerns by keeping order processing logic
 *   out of the controller and model layers.
 * - To make order operations reusable and easier to test.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Implement methods for order creation, retrieval, status updates, and cancellation.
 * - Add input validation for order details and customer information.
 * - Handle exceptions and provide meaningful feedback for invalid operations.
