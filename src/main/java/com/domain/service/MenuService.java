//IF THERE ARE SIMILAR METHODS SCATTERED ACROSS CONTROLLERS OR MENU, THEY SHOULD BE REFACTORED INTO THIS SERVICE LAYER

/**
 * Service class for managing menu-related business logic.
 *
 * The `MenuService` class acts as a bridge between the `Menu` model and the controller layer.
 * It provides business logic and operations for working with the menu, such as retrieving menu
 * items, adding new items, updating existing ones, and performing validations.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - To encapsulate all menu-related operations and ensure separation of concerns.
 * - To provide reusable and testable methods for interacting with the `Menu` model.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Implement methods to interact with the Menu class, such as fetching items by type or name,
 *   adding/removing items, and performing updates.
 * - Add input validation logic for creating and updating menu items.
 * - Handle error cases, such as when a menu item does not exist or when an invalid input is provided.
